SYNOPSIS
JREPL  Search  Replace  [/Option  [Value]]...
JREPL  /{QUEST}[REGEX|REPLACE|VERSION]

  Performs a global regular expression search and replace operation on
  each line of input from stdin and prints the result to stdout.

  Each parameter may be optionally enclosed by double quotes. The double
  quotes are not considered part of the argument. The quotes are required
  if the parameter contains a batch token delimiter like space, tab, comma,
  semicolon. The quotes should also be used if the argument contains a
  batch special character like &, |, etc. so that the special character
  does not need to be escaped with ^.

  Search  - By default, this is a case sensitive JScript (ECMA) regular
            expression expressed as a string.

            JScript regex syntax documentation is available at
            http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ae5bf541(v=vs.80).aspx

  Replace - By default, this is the string to be used as a replacement for
            each found search expression. Full support is provided for
            substituion patterns available to the JScript replace method.

            For example, $& represents the portion of the source that matched
            the entire search pattern, $1 represents the first captured
            submatch, $2 the second captured submatch, etc. A $ literal
            can be escaped as $$.

            An empty replacement string must be represented as "".

            Replace substitution pattern syntax is fully documented at
            http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/efy6s3e6(v=vs.80).aspx

  Options:  Behavior may be altered by appending one or more options.
  The option names are case insensitive, and may appear in any order
  after the Replace argument.

      /A  - Only print altered lines. Unaltered lines are discarded.
            If the /S option is used, then prints the result only if
            there was a change anywhere in the string. The /A option
            is incompatible with the /M option unless the /S option
            is also present.

      /B  - The Search must match the beginning of a line.
            Mostly used with literal searches.

      /E  - The Search must match the end of a line.
            Mostly used with literal searches.

      /F InFile

            Input is read from file InFile instead of stdin.

      /I  - Makes the search case-insensitive.

      /J  - The Replace argument is a JScript expression.
            The following variables contain details about each match:

              $0 is the substring that matched the Search
              $1 through $n are the captured submatch strings
              $off is the offset where the match occurred
              $src is the original source string

      /JBEG InitCode

            JScript inititialization code to be run prior to starting the
            search/replace. This is useful for initializing variables used to
            accumulate information across matches. The default is an empty
            string.

      /JEND FinalCode

            JScript termination code to be run after the search/replace has
            completed. This is useful for writing summarization results.
            The default is an empty string.

      /JMATCH

            Prints each Replace value on a new line, discarding all text
            that does not match the Search. The Replace argument is a
            JScript expression with access to the same $ variables available
            to the /J option.

      /L  - The Search is treated as a string literal instead of a
            regular expression. Also, all $ found in the Replace string
            are treated as $ literals.

      /M  - Multi-line mode. The entire contents of stdin is read and
            processed in one pass instead of line by line, thus enabling
            search for \n. This also enables preservation of the original
            line terminators. If the /M option is not present, then every
            printed line is terminated with carriage return and line feed.
            The /M option is incompatible with the /A option unless the /S
            option is also present.

            Note: If working with binary data containing NULL bytes,
                  then the /M option must be used.

      /N MinWidth

            Precede each output line with the line number of the source line,
            followed by a colon. Line 1 is the first line of the source.

            The MinWidth value specifies the minimum number of digits to
            display. The default value is 0, meaning do not display the
            line number. A value of 1 diplays the line numbers without any
            zero padding.

            The /N option is ignored if the /M or /S option is used.

      /O OutFile

            Output is written to file OutFile instead of stdout.

            A value of "-" replaces the InFile with the output. The output
            is first written to a temporary file with the same name as InFile
            with .new appended. Upon completion, the temporary file is moved
            to replace the InFile.

      /OFF MinWidth

            Ignored unless the /JMATCH option is used. Precede each output
            line with the offset of the match within the original source
            string, followed by a colon. Offset 0 is the first character of
            the source string. The offset follows the line number if the /N
            option is also used.

            The MinWidth value specifies the minimum number of digits to
            display. The default value is 0, meaning do not display the
            offset. A value of 1 displays the offsets without any zero
            padding.

      /S VarName

            The source is read from environment variable VarName instead
            of from stdin. Without the /M option, ^ anchors the beginning
            of the string, and $ the end of the string. With the /M option,
            ^ anchors the beginning of a line, and $ the end of a line.

      /V  - Search, Replace, InitCode, and FinalCode represent the name of
            environment variables that contain the respective values.
            An undefined variable is treated as an empty string.

      /X  - Enables extended substitution pattern syntax with support
            for the following escape sequences within the Replace string:

            \\     -  Backslash
            \b     -  Backspace
            \f     -  Formfeed
            \n     -  Newline
            \q     -  Quote
            \r     -  Carriage Return
            \t     -  Horizontal Tab
            \v     -  Vertical Tab
            \xnn   -  ASCII byte code expressed as 2 hex digits
            \unnnn -  Unicode character expressed as 4 hex digits

            Also enables the \q escape sequence for the Search string.
            The other escape sequences are already standard for a regular
            expression Search string.

            Also modifies the behavior of \xnn in the Search string to work
            properly with extended ASCII byte codes (values above 0x7F).

            Extended escape sequences are supported even when the /L option
            is used. Both Search and Replace support all of the extended
            escape sequences if both the /X and /L opions are combined.

            Extended escape sequences are not applied to JScript code when
            using the /J, /JMATCH, /JBEG, or /JEND options. Use the decode()
            method if extended escape sequences are needed within the code.

  There are global JScript variables/objects/methods that may be used in
  JScript code when using the /J, /JBEG, /JEND, or /JMATCH options:

      ln     - Within Replace code = line number where the match occurred.
               Within /JEND code = total number of lines read.
               This value is always 0 if the /M or /S otion is used.

      env('varName')

               Access to environment variable named varName.

      decode(string)

               Decodes extended escape sequences within a string as defined
               by the /X option, and returns the result. All backslashes must
               be escaped an extra time to use this function in your code.

               Examples:
                   quote literal:       decode('\\q')
                   extended ASCII(128): decode('\\x80')
                   backslash literal:   decode('\\\\')

               This function is only needed if you use the \q sequence
               or \xnn for an extended ASCII code (values above 0x7F).

      input  - The TextStream object from which input is read.
               This may be stdin or a file.

      output - The TextStream object to which the output is written.
               This may be stdout or a file.

      stdin  - Equivalent to WScript.StdIn

      stdout - Equivalent to WScript.StdOut

      stderr - Equivalent to WScript.StdErr
