NAME
      cmdize -- Gives VBScript
 
SYNOPSIS
      cmdize [vbs] [...]
 
OPTIONS
  -h      Help page
 
DESCRIPTION
 This tool converts a supported code into a batch file that can be
 executed without explicit invoking the executable engine. The script
 creates new file and places it under the same directory as the original
 one with the same name, replacing the original extension with ".bat".
 The content of the new file consists of the original file and the
 special header that being the "polyglot" and having some tricks to be a
 valid code in batch file and the wrapped code at the same time.

 FEATURES
 It does comment on "Option Explicit" in VBScript.
 "<xml>" declaration for wsf-files is expected.
 "Option Explicit" and "<xml>" in a single line only are supported.
 BOM is not supported at all.
