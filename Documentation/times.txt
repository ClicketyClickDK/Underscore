DESCRIPTION
  Give a command (with parameters) as argument and get a messured duration 
  of the runtime after output from the command
  
  This function mimics the UNIX commands time or times. Since time is
  a build in command in Windows, the name times is prefered.
  A simple solution of messuring the duration is printing date and 
  time before and after calling the command in question.
  The precision is pretty low (seconds) and some calculation is required.
  Windows CAN actually provide you with a time stamp, that includes milliseconds.
  But the overhead in batch scripting makes this a bit irrelevant (sic)
  However - this is function does provide a duration of a command - in milliseconds
  
  This function uses a call to WMIC getting a timestamp including 
  milliseconds (6 digits).
  Output is duration in hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.
  If duration lasts more than a day - or from one day to the next
  the function indicates this by a no of hours larger than 23 like:
      End  [20151120082435.630000+060]
      Start[20151119075906.977000+060]
      eDiff[1528653]
      iDiff[24:25:28.653]

EXAMPLES
      times dir /s/b
  Produces a list of files followed by timing of runtime:
      Start       [20151119161240.177000+060]
      End         [20151119161240.585000+060]
      Milliseconds[408]
      Duration    [00:00:00.408]
  
  Used in combination with duration:
    @ECHO OFF
    SETLOCAL
        ECHO Show difference between "dir /s" and "dir /s/b
        ECHO:: Initial call = start global timer
        CALL duration _starttime
        ECHO:
        ECHO:: Time the DIR command /S /B
        CALL times dir /s/b>nul
        ECHO:
        ECHO:: Show total duration - so far
        CALL duration _starttime
        ECHO:
        ECHO:: Time the DIR command /S
        CALL times dir /s>nul
        ECHO:
        ECHO Total
        CALL duration _starttime
    ENDLOCAL
  
  Produces:
    Show difference between "dir /s" and "dir /s/b
    : Initial call = start global timer
    _starttime                               [20151120164109.826000+060       ]
