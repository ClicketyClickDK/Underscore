NAME
      hexdump -- Dump a file in hex format
 
SYNOPSIS
      hexdump [/option]... file
 
  -h      Help page
    The format of the dump can be modified by the following case insensitive
    options:
  
      /BblockSize   The blockSize after the /B specifies the number of bytes
                    to print in each block. If the blockSize is >= 0 then /C,
                    /D, /E, /A and /O options are ignored and the bytes are
                    output in a continuous stream without any delimiters or
                    linebreaks.
                    The default blockSize is 1.
  
      /CblockCount  The blockCount after the /C specifies the number of blocks
                    to include on each line of output.
                    The default blockCount is 16.
  
      /DbyteDelim   The byteDelim after the /D specifies the delimiter string
                    to use between bytes within a block.
                    The default byteDelim is undefined (no delimiter)
  
      /EblockDelim  The blockDelim after the /E specifies the delimiter string
                    to use between blocks within a line.
                    The default blockDelim is '/E "' ^(a single space^)
  
      /SstartOffset The startOffset after the /S specifies the number of bytes
                    to skip before displaying bytes.
                    The default startOffset is 0.
  
      /Nlength      The length after the /N specifies the total number of
                    bytes to display after the startOffset. The default is to
                    display up until the end of the file.
  
      /A            Append the ASCII representation of the bytes to the end
                    of each line. Non-printable and extended ASCII characters
                    are displayed as periods.
  
      /O            Prefix each line with the starting offset of the line in
                    hexadecimal notation.
  
      /H            Display hexDump help
  
    Each option must be entered as a separate argument. Numeric components to
    options may be specified using any numeric expression supported by SET /A.
    The option defaults may be modified by presetting a hexDumpDefaults
    variable.
  
DESCRIPTION
    Displays the content of a binary file using a pair of hexadecimal digits
    for each byte. By default the ouput displays 16 bytes per line, with the
    bytes (hexadecimal pairs) delimited by a space.
 
 
EXAMPLES
