  Please note: 
  This function has the following differences from the DosTips "Format":
  1) Name changed to FormatStr due to similarity to the DOS format 
      [You do NOT want to confuse these commands].
  2) "ECHO." changed to "ECHO:" since the "." sometimes fails under Windows 7+
  2) Tags are changed from [] to {} since [] are useful in formatted strings
