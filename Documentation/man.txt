DESCRIPTION 
  man is the system's manual pager. Each page argument given to man is  
  normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page  
  associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed. A  
  section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of the  
  manual. The default action is to search in all of the available sections,  
  following a pre-defined order and to show only the first page found, even  
  if page exists in several sections.
